        <p>BArch Interior Architecture (Chulalongkorn University)<br>MA Public Archaeology (University College London)</p>
		
		  <p class="text-left"><span class="fulltext"><br>I received my Bachelor of Architecture (5-year degree corresponding to Norway's Sivilarkitekt) from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chulalongkorn_University" target="_blank">Chulalongkorn University</a>.<br><br>
		  In 2010, I received a full-scholarship from the Royal Thai Government to study museum exhibition development which resulted in a master degree in Public Archaeology from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_College_London" target="_blank">
		  University College London</a>. 
		  My <a href="https://museumspaces.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/icom-rio-2013.pdf" target="_blank">MA dissertation</a> on sensory design in museums and archaeological sites was accepted to be presented at the ICOM2013 conference. After graduation in 2011, I interned at Haley Sharpe Design, a renowned 
		  museum consultant firm in the UK. Then, in 2012, I started working at the National Science Museum of Thailand where I designed exhibitions and was in committees for new museum buildings across Thailand.<br><br>
		  I also occasionally taught History of Asian Architecture and Introduction to Museum Design at university levels. Prior to starting Anomalist in 2014, I was an architectural consultant for UNESCO, 
		  designing workplace layouts and managing the relocation of UNESCO Asia-Pacific premises. </span><a class="readmore" href="#">more about me</a>
